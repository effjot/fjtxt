fj.txt
======

fj.txt is a theme for WordPress based on blog.txt (version 4.6.1) by
Scott Wallick (http://www.plaintxt.org/).  Blog.txt is designed to
impact your content in the most minimal way: using whitespace as a
major design element, guiding the reader to the content.  fj.txt
follows this design, updating it to the current Wordpress version, and
adapting it to my personal taste and preferences.

This is still work in progress!
